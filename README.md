Trackhub for Dog Long-Read SV Analysis


This trackhub contains structural variants identified relative to the
Mischka (canFam4) genome assembly.


The following tracks are included:

**SV_12**  SVs found though analysis of 12 assemblies using long-read, short-read, and assembly comparisons

**Dog10K** Merged set of SVs genotyped in Dog10K samples based on Manta+Paragraph

**Ohana** SVs above the significant threshold for Ohana analysis


For all tracks the following colors are used:

| SV Type       | Color  |
|---------------|--------|
| Deletion      | Red    |
| Insertion     | Blue   |
| Inversion     | Green  |
| Duplication   | Orange |
| Translocation | Purple |
